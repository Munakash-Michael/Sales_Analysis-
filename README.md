Building an Analysis of 12 months worth of data. 

For this project, I followed a youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMOA1pPVUc4&t=1243s) to explain the steps and tools used in this project. 
After following this tutorial, I practiced my knowledge of pandas and matplotlib libraries and learned about the combination and Counter libraries. 
I learned how to look through and split the data to make it easier for us to group them together to form an analysis.
